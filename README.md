Ever since the advent of social media, Twitter had been an effective tool for mobilizing people towards issues which plague our societies. In this project, we look at one such twitter campaign called the ‘MeToo’ campaign which had created a significant stir on social media. 
We try to analyze the data related to the campaign to figure out the celebrities involved and the sentiments expressed by the people. The motivation for this project is to see how different people have different opinions about a particular topic or a particular person and to see how a social campaign evolves over time. Big data technologies like, Kafka, Storm and Elasticsearch were used to implement this.
